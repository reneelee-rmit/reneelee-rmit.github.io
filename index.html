    <h1> Renee Lee - s3908220@student.rmit.edu.au </h1>
    <h2> A little bit about me... </h2>
    <p> I would describe myself as somewhat of a noob in terms of my IT skills, so I enrolled myself in this
        course to change that! Post-VCE I studied floristry for 2 years at Melbourne Polytechnic and have since
        been working in the industry for the last 3. Although I love my job I miss studying and have become
        increasingly aware of how essential IT skills are in any workplace. To absolutely no one’s surprise my
        hobbies and interests include watching anime, gaming and adding to my ever-growing manga collection –
        how very cliché for an IT student. My all-time favourite Manga author would have to be Junji Ito, even
        if his horrific ideas and art-style do keep me up at night. Some less terrifying favourites include
        Inuyasha, Claymore and Initial D. I really enjoy the unapologetic geekiness and enthusiasm of the
        anime/manga community, everyone is so passionate and fun it really adds to the enjoyment of it all.</p>
    <h2> My Interest in IT </h2>
    <p> Growing up in the 2000’s, I have never really existed without technology. Although there are a
        lot of scary down sides to this, professionally it is provides me with an indisputable
        advantage. In VCE I studied Computing and even though I was pretty successful and enjoyed the
        subject it was eventually put on the backburner while I explored other career opportunities.

        There are a few different experiences that ignited my further interest in IT. Firstly, working
        for a range of small businesses, I realised how difficult so many of the programs and systems
        can be for the average business owner to navigate. I am interested to learn about ways to make
        these programs more user friendly for people without an IT background or learn more so that I
        can help teach people how to use these programs more effectively. Secondly seeing my
        grandparents struggle using basic technology, yet being so determined to keep up inspires me to
        help create something more intuitive and pared back for older and less experienced users to
        enjoy without feeling frustrated and confused. </p>

    <h2> Why RMIT </h2>
    <p> I chose RMIT because I believe that it offers a more friendly, personal and
        industry based education. I have lots of friends who are studying in the RMIT IT
        field and they are all thriving and happy in their courses. During my studies I
        expect to learn about the industry and how to best navigate it and some basic IT
        skills to set me up for further studies. I also expect to find out whether or
        not IT is something that I can see myself really pursuing as a career, if after
        completing this course I do not decide to follow the IT path, I will have
        hopefully picked up some invaluable skills regardless. </p>

        href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51754815?type=standout#searchRequestToken=ca713fd7-45b0-4f75-a334-aec694df2112">APPLICATION
        SUPPORT SPECIALIST Job in Melbourne - SEEK</a>
    <p>This advertised position is seeking a friendly and approachable person with expertise in operating, managing and
        overseeing the various systems and programs that are used within the school. This job is particularly appealing
        to me as it combines IT with heavily people-based work. I enjoy helping people and collaborating so I think that
        it would be perfect for me. The fact that the position is in a school rather than a more corporate style
        business is also something that is favourable to me. The skills and experience that this position requires are a
        familiarity with a range of specific programs and systems, good social and collaborative skills, openness to
        keep learning new things and high level management skills. I am currently lacking in some of these skills, my
        interpersonal skills are something that I think are adequately refined for a position like this, however in
        terms of IT and management skills I would need to do some further study. Undertaking the Bachelor of IT,
        specialising in the Business Administration would provide me with the perfect skills for this position because
        it would equip me with management, business and IT skills. </p>
