            <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'" style="color: #FFEBEE ;">A Little Bit About Me...</h2>
            <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">I would describe myself as somewhat of a noob in terms of my IT
                skills, so I enrolled myself in this
                course to change that! Post-VCE I studied floristry for 2 years at Melbourne Polytechnic and have
                since
                been working in the industry for the last 3. Although I love my job I miss studying and have become
                increasingly aware of how essential IT skills are in any workplace. To absolutely no one’s surprise
                my
                hobbies and interests include watching anime, gaming and adding to my ever-growing manga collection
                –
                how very cliché for an IT student. My all-time favourite Manga author would have to be Junji Ito,
                even
                if his horrific ideas and art-style do keep me up at night. Some less terrifying favourites include
                Inuyasha, Claymore and Initial D. I really enjoy the unapologetic geekiness and enthusiasm of the
                anime/manga community, everyone is so passionate and fun it really adds to the enjoyment of it all.
            </p>

        <div class="column" style="background-color:#C2185B;">
            <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">My Interest in IT</h2>
            <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Growing up in the 2000’s, I have never really existed without
                technology. Although there are a
                lot of scary down sides to this, professionally it is provides me with an indisputable
                advantage. In VCE I studied Computing and even though I was pretty successful and enjoyed the
                subject it was eventually put on the backburner while I explored other career opportunities.

                There are a few different experiences that ignited my further interest in IT. Firstly, working
                for a range of small businesses, I realised how difficult so many of the programs and systems
                can be for the average business owner to navigate. I am interested to learn about ways to make
                these programs more user friendly for people without an IT background or learn more so that I
                can help teach people how to use these programs more effectively. Secondly seeing my
                grandparents struggle using basic technology, yet being so determined to keep up inspires me to
                help create something more intuitive and pared back for older and less experienced users to
                enjoy without feeling frustrated and confused. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column" style="background-color:#AD1457;">
            <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'"> Why RMIT?</h2>
            <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">I chose RMIT because I believe that it offers a more friendly,
                personal and
                industry based education. I have lots of friends who are studying in the RMIT IT
                field and they are all thriving and happy in their courses. During my studies I
                expect to learn about the industry and how to best navigate it and some basic IT
                skills to set me up for further studies. I also expect to find out whether or
                not IT is something that I can see myself really pursuing as a career, if after
                completing this course I do not decide to follow the IT path, I will have
                hopefully picked up some invaluable skills regardless.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'"> Ideal Job </h2>

    <a style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'"
        href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51754815?type=standout#searchRequestToken=ca713fd7-45b0-4f75-a334-aec694df2112">APPLICATION
        SUPPORT SPECIALIST Job in Melbourne - SEEK</a>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'" style="color: #FFEBEE ;" style="text-align:center;"> This advertised
        position is seeking a friendly and approachable person with expertise in operating, managing
        and
        overseeing the various systems and programs that are used within the school. This job is particularly
        appealing
        to me as it combines IT with heavily people-based work. I enjoy helping people and collaborating so I think
        that
        it would be perfect for me. The fact that the position is in a school rather than a more corporate style
        business is also something that is favourable to me. The skills and experience that this position requires
        are a
        familiarity with a range of specific programs and systems, good social and collaborative skills, openness to
        keep learning new things and high level management skills. I am currently lacking in some of these skills,
        my
        interpersonal skills are something that I think are adequately refined for a position like this, however in
        terms of IT and management skills I would need to do some further study. Undertaking the Bachelor of IT,
        specialising in the Business Administration would provide me with the perfect skills for this position
        because
        it would equip me with management, business and IT skills. </p>



    <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Personal Profile </h2>
    <img src="Myers-Briggs.PNG" width="510" height="270">
    <img src="VARK.PNG" width="589" height="224">
    <img src="Five Personalities.PNG" width="509" height="116">



    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">

        My results from the various personality tests are quite favourable to the types of jobs that I am
        interested. My
        Myers-Briggs results identify me as an ENFJ or "The Protagonist", the VARK learning styles test revealed
        that I
        am a multi-modal learner and the five personalities test shows similar information to the Myers-Briggs test
        but
        highlighted that I also open to imagination and experience. These test results are mostly favourable to the
        type
        of jobs that I am interested in and make me a good candidate for leadership roles and teamwork with my
        extraverted and open personality. In contrast, the results also showed that I tend to be fairly emotional
        and
        prone to impulsive behaviour, which can make me a challenging person to work with as well.



        Based on the fact that I am generally tolerant and reliable, I am adept to working in a team, providing that
        I
        don’t become too idealistic or sensitive. Being prone to mood swings and overdoing things might cause
        problems
        within a group, especially faced with people that are more realistic and conservative. My multi modal
        learning
        style means that I use a range of different ways to understand concepts and content. Group work is something
        that could potentially aid my learning, because I tend to learn better through discussions and practical
        example
        which is an essential part of working in a group.



        When forming a team I think that it would be ideal to have a range of different personalities and kinds of
        people so everyone has different strengths and abilities. Working in a group with either too many extraverts
        or
        introverts would be a real challenge. I generally work well with other people who are more proactive, open
        to
        ideas and willing to discuss, rather than people who take a more heavily structured and critical thinkers.

    <H1 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Project Idea - Premium Petals</H1>

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">What is Premium Petals?</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">

        Premium Petals is a courier network app designed specifically for florists. The app will allow florists to
        hire
        verified vehicles and couriers to find localised, regular, delivery work. It will include options for
        tracking,
        proof of delivery and delivery estimates to both customers and businesses. Couriers will be inducted and
        trained
        on how to properly deliver are handle flowers and vehicles will be verified for air-conditioning and safe
        floral
        transport equipment. Having a network set up in a local area will allow for more efficient and reliable
        deliveries with drivers able to earn more with shorter travel time between deliveries. Couriers will be able
        to
        set their delivery range and time frame depending on the day. Premium Petal will also be able to operate as
        a
        third-party service to Shopify, a site that is widely used in the industry. This makes it easy for
        businesses to
        fulfill orders and push all existing information on orders to the couriers. </p>

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Motivation</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Many businesses in the floristry industry rely on outsourced couriers to
        deliver
        their products. Although there
        are many delivery services out there such as Uber Delivery and Sherpa, there is a lack of specialised
        services
        available. The care required to deliver such delicate products is often neglected by these companies and
        flowers
        get damaged during transport. Premium Petals will supply the industry with couriers they can trust to
        deliver
        flowers safely and efficiently all at an affordable price. The ability to coordinate deliveries within a
        smaller
        location and have a smaller number of couriers to deliver is beneficial for businesses, couriers and
        customers.
        It allows for the couriers to execute more deliveries within a smaller about of time meaning lower fuel
        costs
        and more earning capacity. It also means that businesses are able to have their products delivered faster to
        their customers, ensuring a fresher product. </p>

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Features and Services</h2>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Reliable Couriers</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Premium Petals offers businesses with a reliable selection of couriers
        who are
        trained in how to safely and
        securely delivery their flowers. Vehicles will be verified on having the appropriate equipment and utilities
        to
        be delivering flowers. Features such as air-conditioning, ample space and secure transport (eg. Vase
        holders,
        access to watering cans etc.) are essential to the safe arrival of flowers and businesses can be assured
        that
        their products will reach customers as intended. </p>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Localised Network</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Premium Petals allows couriers to set and alter their delivery zone,
        connecting
        them with florists within a local
        area. Having access to a network of businesses within a set zone allows for less time on the road,
        minimising
        fuel consumption and maximising earning capacity for couriers. It also provides businesses and customers
        with
        faster, cheaper and more efficient deliveries, keeping flowers fresh and maintaining quality. </p>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Link to Shopify</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Premium Petals can be linked to business’ Shopify stores, making the
        entire
        process a lot more streamlined and
        easier to navigate. Linking to Shopify means that orders from an online store can be transferred into
        Premium
        Petals along with all existing information including addresses and phone contact numbers of customers. </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Premium Petals provides tracking and routes and navigation for drivers.
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Tracking and Logistics</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Premium Petals provides tracking and routes and navigation for drivers.
        Once a
        driver has accepted deliveries the
        app selects the most efficient route and will then navigate for them once they have left the store. Live
        tracking information will be available to customers and businesses. The app will also have a proof of
        delivery
        feature where couriers can upload a photo on arrival to prove that they have successfully delivered the
        flowers.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'"> The software needed to execute the project would include google maps to
        navigate and route deliveries, a CSS framework build and design the application and a chosen database
        solution to manage and store the information required. In terms of hardware this application will be done in
        a virtual cloud based setting. This will lower costs, ensure flexibility and efficiency for collaborating.

    </p>
    <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Skills Required</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">Premium Petals will require a programmer to develop the app in a language
        such as Python or C++ and a web designer to design the pages. These kinds of skills are both very feasible
        to find in the industry, there are millions of people worldwide who can program in these languages. </p>

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'"> Outcome</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">If Personal Petals proves to be a successful project, florists will have
        access to a delivery network that is tailored to their type of business, ensuring secure and reliable
        deliveries. Drivers will also be able to earn more per hour and minimize fuel costs and customers will
        receive faster, fresher flowers. </p>
